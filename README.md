# `lis.py`

`lis.py` (AKA Lispy) is [Peter Norvig's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig)
Scheme interpreter written in Python. Norvig's blog post about it can be
found [here](https://norvig.com/lispy.html).

From Wikipedia:

> An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes
> instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without
> requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine
> language program.

From [scheme.org](https://www.scheme.org):

> Scheme is a classic programming language in the Lisp family. It
> emphasizes functional programming and domain-specific languages but
> adapts to other styles. Known for its clean and minimalist design,
> Scheme is one of the longest-lived and best-studied dynamic languages,
> and has many fast and portable implementations.

[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) is one
of the oldest programming languages, and it spawned a family of
programming languages. Scheme is a dialect of Lisp.

The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))
article on Lisp describes an interesting aspect of Lisps:

> Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source
> code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code
> as a data structure, giving rise to the macro systems that allow
> programmers to create new syntax or new domain-specific languages
> embedded in Lisp.

[Alan Kay](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523) on Lisp:

> [...] that was the big revelation to me when I was in graduate
> school—when I finally understood that the half page of code on the
> bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself. These
> were “Maxwell’s Equations of Software!” This is the whole world of
> programming in a few lines that I can put my hand over.
